# farmerhelp
this application was developed during a hackathon. 
it uses php as backend. MySql as database to store information and HTML,Javascript and CSS on frontend.

the application providesthe location of nearest farmer from your location using pincode and then you can directly contact the farmer to buy the grains or other things.

this helps small farmers to get desired price of the crop they have grown. 

the application can also be used by retailers too who want to buy the crops in bulk.
